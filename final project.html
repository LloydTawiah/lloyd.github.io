SECTION B  
(4) Summarize  briefly  what you have learned in this course  about the reliability of the Bible  and explain how this has changed your understanding of the Bible  
According to Dr. Emmanuel Kwesi Amoafo’s note on the reliability of the Bible, Bible scholars present four main reasons for the reliability of the Bible. The first reason is fulfilled prophecy. The Bible is the only book whose Prophecy comes to pass. For  example  Psalm 22 and Isaiah 53. 
Also, the unity of the Bible.  Although  it was written by 40 different writers over a period of 1500 years, the bible displays an amazing unity. These writers did not know about each other. They only knew what God was telling them to write and faithfully wrote them down 2 Peter 1:21. After the completion of the bible , most amazingly, after all the books of the bible was gradually collected  it is collected over several centuries and put together in one book it became clear that it became one continues story. The bible reads as if it were a single book written by one person thus 2 Timothy 3: 16 
Furthermore, the bible is the only book which has the transformation and the reformation ability to change the life of human. Men and women throughout the history testify to this  who have come out of the bondage of witchcraft, immorality, addictions, hopelessness and violence change to become good and Godly, God fearing, and God worshipping people .
Finally, the antiquity of the bible and its preservation under constant apostasy. There is no other book in human history that different government and leaders has tried to destroy like the bible. Even today, in many places around the world it is illegal to be found with a copy of the bible, and yet the bible continue to be the best selling book in all time everywhere. 
Fast forward, in the NT the four gospel gives different account of the resurrection of Christ. The four authors of the gospel wrote the account of the life of Jesus  with different aims in mind.
 Matthew wrote his account to a largely Jewish audience to convince  them that Jesus Christ was the messiah prophesied in their scriptures.
 Mark wrote to a largely Roma audience to explain that Jesus was the obedient servant of God.
 Luke, the gentile himself wrote to a largely Greek audience to show that Jesus was the perfect  God –man.
 John wrote to the Church at large to both Jew and Gentile to show that Jesus Christ was the divine son of God John 20: 30-31.
 The three gospel (Matthew, Mark And John) are called synoptic gospel because these three gospels display a high degree of similarity of content, narrative, arrangement, language and sentence and paragraph structures. The fourth gospel, John, differs greatly from the three gospel because the Apostle John wrote from a very different point of view as he explain in John 20:30-31.
